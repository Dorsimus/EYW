# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

Comprehensive testing confirms the critical JavaScript runtime error has been resolved. **CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:** 1) ✅ No Runtime Errors - Application loads without the 'portfolio is not defined' error that was causing Culminating Project dropdown failures, 2) ✅ Enhanced System Components Working - All enhanced features detected and loading properly: Analytics Dashboard, Enhanced Portfolio Management, Culminating Project Integration, Mobile Navigation, Notification System components all present in code structure, 3) ✅ Component Integration - CompetenciesView component now properly receives all required props including portfolio, setCurrentView, showSuccessMessage, showErrorMessage, and user props as specified in the fix, 4) ✅ Backend Support - All backend APIs supporting enhanced features are responding correctly: /api/competencies, /api/ai/health, /api/admin/stats, and user creation endpoints all functional, 5) ✅ Mobile Responsiveness - Mobile navigation components detected and responsive design elements working. **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:** The fix successfully added the missing portfolio prop to CompetenciesView component (line 6259) and all other required props (lines 6260-6263), resolving the ReferenceError that was preventing the enhanced Navigator Level system from functioning. **OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** The portfolio fix has successfully resolved the JavaScript runtime error and made the enhanced Navigator Level system fully functional. All enhanced features are now properly integrated and ready for authenticated users."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All core portfolio functionality is working correctly." with correct names and descriptions, ✅ Cross-Functional Collaboration shows new description 'Breaking Down Silos & Building Unified Property Teams', ✅ Strategic Thinking shows new description 'Think Beyond Today - Lead for Tomorrow', ✅ Navigation between all sections works flawlessly, ✅ Portfolio functionality working with supportive language, ✅ Core Values journaling section fully functional with all 4 values, ✅ Color coding system implemented correctly across all competency areas, ✅ Mobile and tablet responsiveness working perfectly, ✅ Professional design with red triangle emblem and proper branding. **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:** ❌ REFINED COMPETENCY STRUCTURES NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED: Both Cross-Functional Collaboration and Strategic Thinking frameworks are missing their refined 4-competency structures (16 tasks each). Current implementation shows old structure instead of new streamlined competencies. ❌ Cross-Functional Collaboration missing: 'Understanding & Appreciating the Other Department', 'Unified Resident Experience Creation', 'Effective Communication Across Departments', 'Stakeholder Relationship Building'. ❌ Strategic Thinking missing: 'Seeing Patterns & Anticipating Trends', 'Innovation & Continuous Improvement Thinking', 'Problem-Solving with Future Focus', 'Planning & Goal Achievement with Strategic Perspective'. ❌ Curiosity Ignition sections not visible in expanded views, ❌ Time commitment (~12 minutes/week) not clearly displayed, ❌ Interactive elements like 'View Details' buttons not functioning as expected. **ASSESSMENT:** While the platform foundation is excellent and all basic functionality works, the core requirement of implementing refined frameworks with 16 tasks each (instead of old 68/66 task structures) has not been completed. The frontend still shows the old complex structures rather than the streamlined 4-competency frameworks requested."

Investigation shows only 4 emoji elements have display: none style but 36 other emoji elements remain visible. The fix is incomplete - emoji fallbacks are still appearing in the UI. **FLIGHTBOOK SECTION ISSUE:** Core Values section does NOT appear as first section in Flightbook. Testing found only 1 'Core Values' reference in navigation tab, but no Core Values section exists in the main Flightbook content area. The setupRefinedCompetencies fix is not properly integrating Core Values into Flightbook display. **MISSING FUNCTIONALITY:** Core Values story creation interface is completely missing - no 'Add Your Story' buttons, text areas, or forms found in Core Values section. **ROOT CAUSE:** The fixes appear to be partially implemented but are not functioning correctly in the live application. Both critical requirements from review request are failing. **SUCCESS RATE: 40% (2/5 criteria met)** - Only custom branded images (4 found) and absence of 'General Reflections' text are working correctly."
