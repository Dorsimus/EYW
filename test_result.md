# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    - message: "❌ CRITICAL COLOR DESIGN ISSUE IDENTIFIED: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GREEN FIX FAILING! Comprehensive testing of refined color design improvements revealed: ✅ Logo background fix WORKING (red triangle emblem with light gray background, not red/blue gradient), ✅ Softer color gradients WORKING (colors are professional and not harsh), ✅ Parent-child color consistency WORKING (each competency area maintains its color family), ❌ FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CRITICAL FAILURE: Still displays PINK/PURPLE gradient instead of GREEN as requested. Detailed investigation shows: ✅ Correct CSS class 'competency-financial' applied, ✅ Correct CSS variables defined in index.css (#059669 green), ✅ Correct GREEN border-left color (rgb(5, 150, 105)), ❌ INCORRECT background gradient showing pink/purple colors. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: App.css lines 38-40 contain old pink gradient rule '.competency-financial { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%); }' that overrides the correct green gradient defined in index.css. This CSS specificity/order issue causes Financial Management to display pink/purple instead of green, which is exactly the issue mentioned in the review request. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX: Remove or update the conflicting CSS rule in App.css to allow the correct green gradient from index.css to take effect."
