The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Earn Your Wings Platform from MVP to a visually enhanced state, focusing heavily on UI/UX refinements and administrative functionalities. Initially, the work involved integrating the Admin UI, expanding the task library to be more comprehensive and turnkey, and ensuring the Admin panel correctly displayed these tasks. Following this, significant effort was dedicated to a comprehensive design overhaul. This included implementing modern aesthetics like gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and professional typography, and iteratively addressing user feedback regarding icon choices (moving from basic emojis to text-based, then back to polished emojis) and critical text visibility issues (white-on-white). The final phase focused on implementing specific Redstone brand colors and ensuring complete text readability across the application. The persistent setCurrentView is not defined lint error during frontend edits was noted but did not halt progress.

<product_requirements>
The Earn Your Wings Platform is envisioned as a centralized, engaging digital hub for In the Flow of Work learning in property management. It serves as the single source of truth for program activities, emphasizing portfolio-centric career advancement, social learning, mobile-first access, and gamification. Key functionalities include user management (Participants, Mentors, Managers, Admins), dynamic content delivery, a digital portfolio builder with version control, mentorship tools, assessment & competency tracking, and recognition features. The system was designed to use React/Next.js, Node.js/Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL (implemented with MongoDB), Redis, AWS S3, and SSO.

To date, the platform has implemented:
1.  **Portfolio Builder:** Enables participants to upload documents and link them to competencies.
2.  **Navigator Competency Framework:** Integrates five core areas (Leadership, Financial Management, Operational Management, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Strategic Thinking) with detailed sub-competencies.
3.  **Task-Based Completion System:** Automates competency progress updates based on task completion, supporting various task types.
4.  **Admin System:** Features secure JWT authentication for administrators and provides backend APIs for managing tasks, users, and platform statistics.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React.js (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).
-   **Database:** MongoDB for data persistence.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for UI, enhanced with custom CSS for gradients, glassmorphism, and animations.
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure admin access.
-   **File Storage:** Local file storage for MVP document uploads.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** RESTful API communication between frontend and backend.
-   **Competency Tracking:** Dynamic progress calculation based on task completion.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** This file contains the core backend logic, including all API endpoints for user, portfolio, competency, and task management, along with JWT-based admin functionalities.
    -   **Changes made:** Initially implemented core functionalities. During the trajectory, the  list (lines 294-448) was significantly expanded from 10 to over 26+ industry-specific tasks to provide more comprehensive coverage across competency areas, making the platform more turnkey.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the main React component responsible for application routing, state management, displaying various views (dashboard, portfolio, tasks), and handling user interactions. It serves as the primary UI entry point.
    -   **Changes made:** Extensively modified throughout the trajectory.
        -   **Admin UI Integration:** Components like , , , , and an Admin login modal were integrated, with conditional rendering based on user role and authentication.
        -   **Task Editing Modal:** The inline task editing form was replaced with a modal popup () to improve UX, addressing the issue of the form appearing off-screen. This involved refactoring state management (, ).
        -   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Numerous styling changes were applied. This included:
            -   Adding modern gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations.
            -   Updating headers, stats cards, navigation, and competency cards with a professional, engaging design.
            -   Iteratively adjusting icons (from basic to text-based, then to polished emojis) and fixing text contrast issues (e.g., white text on white backgrounds, then overly light text) in hero sections, navigation, and statistics displays.
            -   Implementing Redstone brand colors (red #ff3443, blue #0127a2, gray #efefef) across various UI elements, including headers, navigation, stats cards, progress bars, and text.
        -   **Error Handling (Lint):** Repeated  occurred during various edits, indicating a linting issue, but the development continued.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes made:** Already included  and  for authentication prior to this trajectory. No new dependencies were explicitly added within the observed trajectory.

-   **/app/admin_create.py**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** A utility script to create an initial admin user for database seeding and testing.
    -   **Changes made:** This file was created before the trajectory and not modified within it.

-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** Contains global CSS styles for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes made:** Modified to introduce global design elements like gradient backgrounds, keyframe animations, and custom CSS properties for consistent styling across components, supporting the overall UI/UX overhaul and Redstone branding.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Role-Based Access Control Refinement:** Ensure all routes and UI elements are strictly controlled by the authenticated user's role (Participant vs. Admin) beyond just the login. (This was a general pending task identified early in the trajectory, not explicitly revisited or confirmed as fully done.)
-   **Admin UI Functionality Validation:** Thoroughly test the CRUD operations for tasks and user management via the newly implemented admin frontend. (Backend APIs were tested, but full frontend CRUD testing was not explicitly shown to be completed.)

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a detailed iterative process of enhancing the platform's visual design and addressing user feedback on specific UI elements, particularly regarding text visibility and brand color implementation.

The work encompassed:
1.  **Redstone Brand Color Implementation:** The user requested the use of Redstone colors (red #ff3443, blue #0127a2, gray #efefef). The engineer systematically applied these colors to various UI components, including the Earn Your Wings title header, navigation button backgrounds, statistics card backgrounds, progress bar gradients, and percentage displays.
2.  **Text Visibility Fixes:** A critical focus was on resolving white-on-white text issues and ensuring all text elements had proper contrast and readability.
    -   Initially, Navigator Program, Demo Navigator, and 0% Complete were identified as hard to see. The engineer updated these to a light gray ().
    -   Subsequently, the user reported Welcome back, Demo Navigator! and Track your progress... were still too light. The engineer then specifically changed Welcome back, Demo Navigator! to bold Redstone blue () and Track your progress... to dark gray () to ensure perfect readability while retaining the desired light gray cards.
3.  **Overall Design Consistency:** The goal was to achieve a cohesive, professional Redstone brand identity across the entire application, maintaining the previously implemented glassmorphism, gradients, and animations where appropriate.

The last action taken was a screenshot to verify that the hero text (Welcome back, Demo Navigator! and Track your progress...) was now properly dark and readable, which was confirmed successful, indicating all previously reported white text visibility issues were resolved and Redstone branding finalized to the user's satisfaction for these elements. The  and  files were the primary targets for these ongoing design adjustments.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user if they wish to proceed with further enhancements or to test the complete admin workflow now that design issues are resolved.
