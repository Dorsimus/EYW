The previous AI engineer successfully built the Earn Your Wings Platform MVP in several phases. Initially, a portfolio builder with Navigator competency tracking was developed, replacing manual progress sliders with a dynamic system and supporting local file uploads. This involved significant backend development with FastAPI and MongoDB, and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS. Following this, a task-based competency system was integrated, linking task completion to progress percentages. This required extensive debugging for MongoDB serialization and complex React rendering issues. Finally, a robust Admin system was implemented, providing JWT-authenticated backend APIs for task and user management, and platform analytics. The ongoing work involves integrating this backend functionality with the Admin user interface in the frontend to enable full administrative control.

The Earn Your Wings Platform aims to be a centralized, engaging digital platform for In the Flow of Work learning and development in property management. Its core purpose is to be the single source of truth for program activities, emphasizing portfolio-centric career advancement, social learning, mobile-first access, and gamification. Key functional requirements include user management (Participants, Mentors, Managers, Admins), dynamic content delivery, a digital portfolio builder with version control, mentorship tools, assessment & competency tracking, and recognition features. Technically, it uses React/Next.js, Node.js/Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL (MongoDB in implementation), Redis, AWS S3, and SSO.

So far, the platform has implemented:
1.  **Portfolio Builder:** Allows participants to upload documents and link them to competencies.
2.  **Navigator Competency Framework:** Integrated five core areas (Leadership, Financial Management, Operational Management, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Strategic Thinking) with detailed sub-competencies.
3.  **Task-Based Completion System:** Replaced manual sliders, where task completion automatically updates competency percentages. Supports various task types like course links, assessments, and project uploads.
4.  **Admin System:** Includes secure JWT authentication for admin users, and backend APIs for managing tasks, users, and viewing platform statistics.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React.js (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).
-   **Database:** MongoDB for data storage (user profiles, competencies, tasks, portfolios).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for UI.
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure admin access.
-   **File Storage:** Local file storage for MVP document uploads.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Frontend-backend communication via RESTful APIs.
-   **Competency Tracking:** Dynamic calculation of progress based on task completion.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate frontend and backend directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the core of the backend application, handling all API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic. It defines routes for user management, portfolio uploads, competency tracking, task management, and admin functionalities.
    -   **Changes made:**
        -   Initial setup for user profiles and competency tracking.
        -   Added routes and logic for portfolio document uploads.
        -   Integrated task management functionalities (CRUD for tasks, linking tasks to competencies).
        -   Implemented JWT-based authentication for admin users (login, protected routes).
        -   Added admin-specific routes for task management (create, update, delete, get all tasks), user management, and platform statistics.
        -   Fixed MongoDB  serialization issues across various endpoints by ensuring data is converted to JSON-serializable formats (e.g., UUIDs or strings) before being sent as responses.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the main React component, serving as the central hub for the entire user interface. It manages routing, state, displays the dashboard, competency views, portfolio, and task modals, and handles user interactions.
    -   **Changes made:**
        -   Initial dashboard and portfolio builder UI.
        -   Integrated the Navigator competency framework display.
        -   Updated progress tracking from manual sliders to reflect task completion.
        -   Implemented the task modal to display task details and allow completion/evidence submission.
        -   Extensive debugging and fixing of React rendering errors related to data structure inconsistencies, particularly when displaying objects as children or handling dates.
        -   Added an Admin button and an Admin login modal.
        -   Integrated components for the Admin interface: , , , and . This includes conditional rendering of admin-specific navigation and content based on user role and authentication status.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes made:** Added  and  for authentication.

-   **/app/admin_create.py**:
    -   **Summary of importance:** A utility script created to facilitate the initial setup of an admin user for testing and deployment.
    -   **Changes made:** New file created to programmatically add an admin user to the database with predefined credentials.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Role-Based Access Control Refinement:** Ensure all routes and UI elements are strictly controlled by the authenticated user's role (Participant vs. Admin) beyond just the login.
-   **Admin UI Functionality Validation:** Thoroughly test the CRUD operations for tasks and user management via the newly implemented admin frontend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of completing the frontend integration for the Admin user interface. This involved:
1.  **Integrating Admin Views:** Adding the , , , and  components into . This makes the admin-specific functionalities (like task management, user oversight, and platform statistics) accessible through the UI after an administrator logs in.
2.  **Updating Navigation:** Modifying the application's header and navigation to include an Admin button and conditional tabs/views that appear when an admin is logged in, allowing them to switch between different administrative functions.
3.  **Verification:** The last action was initiating a screenshot to visually confirm the successful rendering and functionality of the newly integrated Admin dashboard and its components. The backend APIs for these admin functionalities are already built and tested.

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly test the complete Admin interface, including task creation, editing, deletion, user management, and statistics display.
