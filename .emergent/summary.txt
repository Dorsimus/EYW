The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Earn Your Wings Platform by first focusing on UI/UX enhancements and then diligently addressing core functional issues identified during this process. Initially, the work involved extensive UI/UX refinements, including Redstone brand color implementation, text visibility fixes across various UI elements, and enhancing navigation button aesthetics with depth and movement. A major challenge encountered was a persistent frontend loading issue, which was meticulously troubleshooted through multiple iterations. Root causes identified included hardcoded preview URLs, mismatched user ID generation between frontend and backend, and React Strict Mode causing double execution of initialization logic. Although the backend was confirmed functional, a temporary frontend bypass was implemented to allow continued UI development. Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing Admin Panel issues, which were resolved by implementing demo admin data, fixing navigation duplications, and ensuring admin state persistence. Finally, a significant new feature, the Culminating Project, was added to the Competencies section, including detailed subtasks, Mark Complete functionality, and a complex restructuring into logical phases matching the existing competency section format, all confirmed as successfully implemented.

<product_requirements>
The Earn Your Wings Platform is a centralized digital hub for In the Flow of Work learning in property management, emphasizing portfolio-centric career advancement, social learning, mobile-first access, and gamification. It manages user roles (Participants, Mentors, Managers, Admins), delivers dynamic content, builds digital portfolios, tracks competencies, and offers recognition. The platform utilizes React/Next.js, FastAPI/Python, and MongoDB.

Current implementation includes:
1.  **Portfolio Builder**: For uploading documents linked to competencies.
2.  **Navigator Competency Framework**: Five core areas (Leadership, Financial, Operational, Cross-Functional, Strategic) with detailed sub-competencies.
3.  **Task-Based Completion System**: Automates competency progress updates.
4.  **Admin System**: JWT authentication for managing tasks, users, and statistics.

Recent enhancements have focused on comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, Redstone brand integration, fixing text visibility, and refining navigation. The admin panel was significantly improved with demo data, corrected navigation, and persistent state. A detailed Culminating Project with trackable subtasks, structured into phases matching other competency sections, has been fully integrated.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React.js (frontend) with FastAPI (backend).
-   **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, custom CSS for gradients, glassmorphism, animations.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure admin access, temporary demo bypasses for development.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: RESTful API communication (Axios on frontend).
-   **State Management**: React's  and  for application and user state.
-   **Development Utilities**:  for debugging complex issues, Playwright for automated frontend testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Contains core backend logic, API endpoints for user, portfolio, competency, task management, and JWT-based admin functions.
    -   **Changes made**: Expanded  from 10 to over 26+ industry-specific tasks (lines 294-448) to make the platform more turnkey. User creation endpoint was examined, but logic remained UUID-based; no direct modifications were made to it within the trajectory to accommodate specific IDs.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Main React component for routing, state management, displaying views (dashboard, portfolio, tasks, admin), and handling user interactions. Central for UI logic.
    -   **Changes made**: Heavily modified for UI/UX enhancements and functional fixes:
        -   **UI/UX**: Adjusted styling for headers, stats cards, navigation, and competency cards with Redstone brand colors (red #ff3443, blue #0127a2, gray #efefef), gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism. Iteratively fixed text contrast issues (e.g., white-on-white, light gray text made darker) and refined navigation buttons (smaller, depth, wiggle animation).
        -   **Loading/User Init Fixes**: Modified  and  hooks (lines 58-65, 94-140) to correctly handle user creation/loading. Temporarily set hardcoded user/admin state to bypass hanging API calls for UI development (lines 66-90, 343-365, 550-570). Fixed hardcoded  references (e.g., line 103, 160, 172, 182, 276, 293).
        -   **Admin UI**: Integrated Admin views (, , , ), with conditional rendering. Fixed duplicate Dashboard buttons (lines 727-750) and ensured admin state persistence during navigation (lines 245, 247).
        -   **Culminating Project**: Added  data structure (lines 1760-1798, etc.). Integrated  section into  (lines 1080-1110, etc.), including progress display, Mark Complete buttons, and completion modal. Refactored  into 3 phases (Planning, Execution, Completion) with  buttons that open the  for each phase's subtasks, involving extensive changes to  and  logic (lines 1900-2200).
        -   **Modals**: Replaced inline task editing with . Added click-outside-to-close functionality to  (line 1931).
        -   **Linting**: Recurring  and other lint errors were noted but not fully resolved, as they didn't prevent app functionality.

-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Contains global CSS styles for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes made**: Modified to implement global design elements like gradient backgrounds, keyframe animations (e.g., wiggle effect for navigation buttons), and custom CSS properties for consistent Redstone branding and UI/UX overhaul (lines 1-100, etc.).

-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, crucially .
    -   **Changes made**: Corrected the  from a hardcoded preview URL to a local backend URL to resolve frontend loading issues (Message 27).

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Role-Based Access Control Refinement**: Ensure all routes and UI elements are strictly controlled by the authenticated user's role (Participant vs. Admin) beyond just the login, as the current admin implementation uses temporary demo data.
-   **Admin UI Functionality Validation**: Thoroughly test the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks and user management via the newly implemented admin frontend. (Backend APIs were tested, but full frontend CRUD testing for all operations was not explicitly shown to be completed or verified for all admin actions).
-   **Frontend-Backend Integration Fix**: Resolve the underlying issue causing frontend Axios POST requests (specifically user creation) to hang, which led to the implementation of temporary demo data.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the Culminating Project section within the Competencies view to align its format with other competency sections.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Restructuring Culminating Project**: The initial 10 subtasks of the Culminating Project were refactored into three logical phases:
    *   **Planning Phase** (4 subtasks)
    *   **Execution Phase** (3 subtasks)
    *   **Completion Phase** (3 subtasks)
    This involved updating the data structure and rendering logic within  to group related subtasks.
2.  **Implementing View Tasks Buttons**: For each of the newly defined phases (Planning, Execution, Completion), a View Tasks button was added. This mirrors the existing functionality of other competency sections where clicking View Tasks opens a modal displaying the tasks within that subgroup.
3.  **Integrating with TaskModal**: The  component and its associated  function were modified to correctly display the specific subtasks belonging to the selected Culminating Project phase when the View Tasks button is clicked. This ensures consistent user experience across the platform.
4.  **Progress Tracking Update**: Progress indicators were updated to reflect completion within each phase (e.g., 0/4 tasks for the Planning Phase), maintaining consistency with existing progress display logic.

The last action performed was a successful test and comprehensive summary (Message 351), confirming that the Culminating Project now perfectly matches the format of other competency sections, with phases, View Tasks buttons, and proper task viewing functionality through modals.
