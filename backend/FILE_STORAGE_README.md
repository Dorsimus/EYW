## 🔒 Security Features

### File Validation
- **Size Limit**: 50MB maximum per file
- **Type Restrictions**: PDF, Office docs, images, videos, text files only
- **MIME Type Validation**: Double-check against file extensions
- **Filename Sanitization**: UUID prefixed, special characters removed

### Storage Security
- **Organized Paths**: Year-month-user hierarchy prevents conflicts
- **Secure Filenames**: `{UUID}_{sanitized_original_name}.ext`
- **Access Control**: File serving through API with permission checks
- **Soft Deletes**: Files marked as deleted, not immediately removed

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Portfolio Management
```
POST /api/users/{user_id}/portfolio
- Enhanced with file validation, secure storage
- Supports visibility controls (private, managers, mentors, public)
- Automatic file metadata tracking

GET /api/users/{user_id}/portfolio?visibility=private
- Filter by visibility level
- Includes formatted file sizes
- Only returns active (non-deleted) items

DELETE /api/users/{user_id}/portfolio/{item_id}
- Soft delete with file cleanup
- Removes from competency evidence tracking
```

### File Serving
```
GET /api/files/{file_type}/{file_id}
- Secure file access with basic permission checking
- Supports portfolio and evidence file types
- Returns files with original filenames
```

### Admin Storage Management
```
GET /api/admin/storage/stats
- Complete storage usage breakdown
- File count and size statistics
- Database record vs file system sync status
```

## 📊 Enhanced Data Models

### PortfolioItem (Enhanced)
```python
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "competency_areas": ["list"],
    "file_path": "/secure/path/to/file",
    "original_filename": "document.pdf",
    "secure_filename": "uuid_document.pdf",
    "file_size": 1024000,
    "mime_type": "application/pdf",
    "file_type": "portfolio",
    "visibility": "private|managers|mentors|public",
    "tags": ["list"],
    "status": "active|archived|deleted",
    "upload_date": "datetime",
    "updated_at": "datetime"
}
```

## 🛠 Utility Functions

### File Management
- `validate_file()` - Security and constraint validation
- `generate_secure_filename()` - UUID-based secure naming
- `get_file_storage_path()` - Organized directory creation
- `save_uploaded_file()` - Complete upload handling with validation
- `delete_file()` - Safe file deletion with error handling
- `format_file_size()` - Human-readable file size formatting

## 🎯 Ready for MVP Testing

### Current Capabilities
✅ Secure file uploads with validation  
✅ Organized storage structure  
✅ File serving with access control  
✅ Portfolio management with visibility controls  
✅ Storage monitoring and statistics  
✅ Integration with existing competency system  

### Next Phase Enhancements (Week 2-3)
- Advanced access control based on user roles
- File versioning for portfolio items
- Bulk file operations
- Cloud storage migration preparation
- Advanced file type processing (thumbnails, previews)

## 🚀 Migration to Cloud Storage

The system is designed to easily migrate to cloud storage (Azure Blob, AWS S3) by:
1. Updating `save_uploaded_file()` function
2. Modifying file serving endpoint
3. Keeping all security and validation logic intact
4. Maintaining the same API interface

This provides a solid foundation for the MVP while being ready to scale to cloud infrastructure.
